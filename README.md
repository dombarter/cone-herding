# Cone Herding
This is the repository for my 2018-2019 OCR A Level Programming Project. 

My chosen project is a robot that can be be placed in a zone of unknown dimensions and herd cones within the zone to one location. The robot will be completely autonomous.

This project will also be released as an advanced movement library for other Vex programmers. 

This inspiration and idea for this project comes from the idea of clearing cones from a work site.
